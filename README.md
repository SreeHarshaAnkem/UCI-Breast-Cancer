# UCI : Predict the incidence of Breast cancer. 
## Objective :
Utility to create optimal threshold probability for any classifier. 

## Components:
 - Generate predicted probabilities
 - Generate precision recall curves
 - Calculate F1 score for all thresholds
 - Choose the threshold that maximises F1_beta(Depending on the importance of recall/precision)
 - Generate metrics based on chosen optimal threshold probability.
